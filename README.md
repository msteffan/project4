MedTrack is an application designed to help doctors keep track of their patients and the medications they are taking. 

Difficulties I faced: 
1. This was my first MEAN Stack App that had more than one model and factory
2. I tried to add User Authentication but do to my unfamiliarity with the MEAN Stack and lack of time it did not work out

Things I would like to add in the future: 
1. Using some sort of drug API 
2. User Authentication
